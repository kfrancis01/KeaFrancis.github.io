<h2> Project Description:</h2>

<p>This is a personal project that extended from the team attempt to make an
autonomous garbage can for my Mechatronics course. The goal of the project
is to create a device that will move from a docking station to a designated spot,
wait for the trash load to be lifted out, then return to its home position.<p>

<h2> Mechatronics (ME 405) Project Description:</h2>
<p>The objective of the project was to have a
proof of concept device navigate to a
designated location, wait for weight to be lifted
out, then return to its original position without
user intervention.<p>
<p>My team and I were able to get the motors to move, get an infrared light sensor that stopped
the motors once it got a reading from another sensor, and have the motors move again when
the limit switches were no longer triggered.
We unexpectedly ran into an issue with the tires we originally selected. They worked well
on smooth surfaces but had trouble on carpet. A correction we would have liked to make was getting more robust treaded tires.<p>

<h2> Project Pieces:</h2>

<p>This project has been split into smaller projects. Each project is currently in the work in progress phase.<p>

<h4> Project I:</h4> Assemble a four wheeled chassis as a prototype for desired sensor integration and motion control.

<h4> Project II:</h4> Use ROS and Gazebo set up on my personal laptop so that I can run simulations of the device.

<h4> Project III:</h4> Program sensors and motors using an Arduino. Connect Raspberry Pi to Arduino using UART.

<h4> Project IV:</h4> Use Raspberry Pi for computer vision in order to recognize home base, obstacles, and curb spot.

<h4> Project V:</h4> Design an Android app that can communicate with the device to schedule trash pick up dates.
