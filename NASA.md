<h2>NASA RASCAL Mars Ice Challenge Robot</h2><br/>

<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>A device had to be designed that could go
through a simulation of Marâ€™s surface, dig
through the soil, and collect/melt down the ice
underneath<p>
  
<h3>Skills:</h3>
* Arduino Wiring and Programming
* Communication
* Technical Writing
* Organization

<h3>Personal Role</h3>
<p>I decided to join the electrical team for this project I collaborated with an Electrical Engineering
student and an Aerospace Engineering student Through my participation I was able to gain comfort
with Arduinos and wiring I focused on wiring a thermocouple and getting an accurate read out I
also attempted to create a GUI in MatLab however, the program would freeze any computer I used it on<p>
