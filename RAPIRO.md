<h3> Project Summary </h3><br/>
<p>Rapiro is a user friendly device for parents to run through tailored
linguistics lessons with their children at home It was designed to assist
speech therapist when teaching children with speech impediments.<p>
  
<h3> Skills:</h3>
* Python Programming on Linux OS <br/>
* MIT App Inventor <br/>
* Linux OS through Raspberry Pi <br/>
* Arduino Motor Control (C/C++) <br/>
* RFCOMM Bluetooth Protocol <br/>
* Documentation and Research <br/>

<h3> Description:</h3>
<p>The robot included an android phone that would run an application developed using MIT App Inventor. 
The brain of the system was a Raspberry Pi running the Raspbian OS. Once the phone was connected to the Raspberry Pi through Bluetooth, a Python program would run. 
The app displayed a face that asked the child to say a word. It would then record the response to be later analyzed by speech therapists before moving on to the next word.<p>

<h3> Personal Role:</h3>
<p>I started by adding a feature to record the childrenâ€™s response to the robot while going through the lesson plans. 
I would continuously update the Python and MIT App programs to the tailored lessons plans for each child. 
In order to make the robot user friendly and faster, I updated the system from the original Raspberry Pi to the Raspberry Pi 3. 
This included gaining familiarity with the RFCOMM Bluetooth protocol so that the Raspberry Pi could seamlessly communicate with the phone.<p>
