## Skills Learnt:
* Pro Engineer
* 3D Printing

## What I did
<p>This project was over the course of two summers during my internship at the*Vanderbilt
University ARMA Lab*. I would receive direction from the graduate student in charge of
the project regarding what he wanted for the_3D model_. I would then take his directions
and translate them into designs on Pro Engineer. I would make sure that the design was
practical by running simulations to make sure that the joints actuated correctly. I was
later able to 3D print the components and wire it with Kevlar string.<p>
