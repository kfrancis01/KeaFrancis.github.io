<h3>MRI Compatible Robot at Vanderbilt ARMA Lab</h3></br>

<h2> Skills Learnt:</h2>
* Pro Engineer
* 3D Printing

<h2> Project Dsecription / Personal Contributions </h2>
<p>This project was over the course of two summers during my internship at the*Vanderbilt
University ARMA Lab. I would receive direction from the graduate student in charge of
the project regarding what he wanted for the_3D model_. I would then take his directions
and translate them into designs on Pro Engineer. I would make sure that the design was
practical by running simulations to make sure that the joints actuated correctly. I was
later able to 3D print the components and wire it with Kevlar string.<p>
