<h1>Starting My Robotics Career </h1></br>
<h3>Getting my foot into the door</h3>
<p>I wish I could go back and time and tell myself that internships, research, and extracurriculars still weren't enough to get into the robotics field.
I knew that such a niche field would be difficult to break into; however, I was not prepared for the varying responces (or lack of responses) I would get.
What seems to be consistent is that I need "experience". No company wants to be the company that invests time, resources, and money into someone unvetted just
for them to potentially not work out or leave for greener pastures before they have seen a return in their investments. Atleast this seems to be the case unless
you are lucky enough to find a small part time robotics engineering position. These definetely are not easy to come by so it is a better plan to build your portfolio
and take online courses that will give you relevant certifications.<p>

<p>I'm hoping that I will find my barrings soon.<p>
